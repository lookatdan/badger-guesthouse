# Design Prototyping Kit

## What is this?
This is a sensible toolkit for starting large front-end projects, and for prototyping designs for the web. It is opinionated, and a detailed guide to the suggested methodology for working with this toolkit will follow.

## Who is this for?
This is not a CSS library for engineers looking to get their MVP app styled quickly; there are already many excellent tools for that. This is a set of tools and a methodology for front-end engineers who write hundreds (if not thousands) of lines of CSS on a daily basis, on large projects, and seek to avoid introducing technical debt. This is also a handy starting point for front-end engineers who design in-browser.

## Requirements
You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Installation
In your terminal, `cd` into the root, then run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Run `gulp` to compile your styles and watch for changes.
