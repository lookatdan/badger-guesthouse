/*
    this mixin is intended to be used on the :root element.
    we use it to set a base font-size which is based on the viewport
    width, and which scales between two font-sizes we've set, at two
    viewport widths that we've also set. We then use CSS variables to
    set REM unit values for individual type elements, based on 3
    different typographic scales. We set these as extends, for easier
    overriding of an element's font-size in the rest of the codebase.
